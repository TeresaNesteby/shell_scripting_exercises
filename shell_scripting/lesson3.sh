# Exercise 1:
# Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status." Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.


# if [ "teresa" = "teresa" ]
# then
#   echo "This script will exit with a 0 exit status."
#   exit 0
# fi

# ---

# Exercise 2:
# Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.


# read -p "Name a file, any file." FILENAME
# if [ -d "$FILENAME" ]
# then
#   echo "$FILENAME is a directory"
#   exit 1
# elif [ -f "$FILENAME" ]
#   then
#     echo "$FILENAME is a regular file"
#     exit 0
# else
#   exit 2
# fi

# Exercise 3:
# Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow". If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/shadow
if ["$?" -eq "0"]
  then echo "Command succeeded"
  exit 0
else
  echo "Command failed"
  exit 1
